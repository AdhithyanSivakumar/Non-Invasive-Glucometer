## Abstract:
The abstract provides an overview of the importance of non-invasive glucometers in managing diabetes. It highlights the drawbacks of invasive glucose measurement methods and the need for a non-invasive alternative. The abstract also mentions the keywords associated with the paper.

## Introduction:
The introduction section provides background information and motivation for the study. It explains the prevalence of diabetes worldwide and the significance of regular blood glucose monitoring. The section also introduces the non-invasive methods used for glucose measurement, such as near-infrared spectroscopy, photoacoustic spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and polarization. The choice of near-infrared spectroscopy as the preferred method for the project is justified based on its accuracy and ease of implementation.

## Project Objectives:
The objectives of the project are clearly outlined in this section. The main objectives include predicting blood glucose levels non-invasively and displaying them on an LCD screen. The goal is to provide an alternative, low-cost solution to traditional invasive glucose testing methods.

## Deliverables Planned:
The planned deliverables for the project are listed, detailing the key steps and outcomes to be achieved. These include using NIR spectroscopy to predict relative glucose levels, designing an analog circuit model for voltage amplification, achieving a multiple linear regression model for glucose level prediction, and displaying the voltage value and corresponding glucose level on an LCD screen.

## Principles Used:
This section describes the principles used in the project, particularly the Beer-Lambert Law and the glucose measuring principle. The Beer-Lambert Law states the relationship between the amount of light absorbed and the concentration of the solute in the solution. The glucose measuring principle explains how glucose concentration affects the intensity of light scattered from tissue, leading to changes in the optical paths.

## Existing Works in the Field:
The existing works in the field of non-invasive glucose monitoring are discussed in this section. Various techniques, such as mid-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and terahertz spectroscopy, are mentioned. The advantages and limitations of each technique are highlighted. Near-infrared spectroscopy is emphasized as the method of choice for the project due to its selectivity and affordability.

## Circuit Diagram:
A schematic block diagram of the prepared model is presented in this section. It provides an overview of the circuit components and their connections, illustrating the overall design of the non-invasive glucometer.

## Components Used:
The hardware components used in the project are listed, along with their functionalities. These include the Arduino board (UNO), LCD (RG1602 A), Op-amp TL072, photodiode, and phototransistor. The roles of the photodiode and phototransistor in the measurement process are explained, and the choice of using infrared light (940nm wavelength) is justified.
